## The Whip and Nae Nae Cat in Java
Thanks to advances in `// coffee technology`, Java powers over 3 billion devices.


![The only amusing fact from Java's installation.](https://techblog.willshouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/java-3-billion-devices-run-java.png)

We can now use it to power this cat... What he do!!

```
public class WhipAndNaeNaeCat extends Animal {
    public AnimalBehavior animalBehavior;
    public void update(double deltaTime) {
        animalBehavior.update(deltaTime);
        animalBehavior = new WhipAndNaeNaeBehavior();
    }
    // Pretend there is more code
}
```
As you can see, the whip and nae nae cat eternally whips and nae naes by changing its behavior to a thing called `WhipAndNaeNaeBehavior` every frame.
This is not good! You shouldn't have to create a new object every frame. That wastes resources, and the garbage man will be very mad.

Unfortunately, we have learned that the whip and nae nae cat is poorly optimized.
